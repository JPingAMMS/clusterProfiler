	abstract = {Although genomewide {RNA} expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ({GSEA)} for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, {GSEA} reveals many biological pathways in common. The {GSEA} method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},
